# Disease Prediction System Project
# Overview
This project is a Disease Prediction System built using Machine Learning techniques to predict various diseases based on medical test data. The model utilizes multiple features such as glucose levels, cholesterol, hemoglobin, and other health-related data points to classify and predict diseases such as Diabetes, Heart Disease, Anemia, Thalassemia, and others.

The system is designed to assist healthcare professionals and researchers by providing a quick and efficient way to analyze medical data and predict potential health conditions.

# Datasets
The dataset used for training and testing the model contains medical data from various sources, including health indicators and the corresponding disease labels.

Feel free to update or add more datasets for additional disease classifications.

# Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing: The dataset is preprocessed to clean and handle missing values, outliers, and normalize the data.
2. Model Training: The project uses machine learning algorithms (like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.) to train a model based on the dataset.
3. Disease Prediction: The model can predict multiple diseases based on input features.
4. Confusion Matrix & Metrics: Visualizes the performance of the trained model with confusion matrix and various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

# Future Enhancements
Add more diseases to the prediction model (e.g., Heart Attack, Cancer, etc.).
Improve the model with advanced algorithms (e.g., Deep Learning or Neural Networks).
Build a web-based user interface to make the system more accessible to healthcare professionals.
